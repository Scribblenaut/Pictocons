Like Robohash.org, but you can make your own with your own images

Note: This code will be turned into a website. Also, excuse this sloppy mess that I call code. Beware of the confusing lack of organization, lack of helpful comments and all the trashy commented out stuff (as well as the regions I like to hide them in >_< ).

TODO: 
1. Write code to choose an image from the xml file.
2. Merge the images together.(also upload the images here)
3. Resize it so there are more sizes available.
4. Work on the homepage design
5. Implement a way for people to submit their own images
6. Clean up all the sloppy stuff
7. Put meaningful comments every other line at least
8. Explain how it works
7. ???
8. Profit
